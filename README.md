This is a repository for our Bioresource Technology Reports 2020 paper titled: ["Predictive modeling and response analysis of spent catalyst bioleaching using artificial neural network".](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589014X20300104)

Model training and optimization was performed with Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and anaconda framework (Anaconda Software Distribution, 2016) was used for code development.
